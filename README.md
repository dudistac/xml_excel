# xml_excel
A lightweight tool to read/write excel files using the python standard library.

Notes:
- This is a small project built for fun, curiosity, and the challenge of working with technical restrictions/limited data.
- Currently the data upload happens only in the PC memory --> in large excel files, the script is limited by the PC specs
- Only supports a single sheet, after each read the previous is overwritten

TO-DO:
- Add option to handle file modification on the harddrive
- Add multiple worksheet support
